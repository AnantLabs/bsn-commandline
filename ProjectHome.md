# Introduction #

This library is a framework for implementing command-line applications with an interface similar to the Windows "netsh".

It supports (sub)contexts, commands, tags/parameters, lists and configuration entries. Only very little code and some metadata create a flexible full command-line interface including dynamic help system.
